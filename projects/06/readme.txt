1.Instruction on how to compile:
(Lets use command line to compile)

$cd src
$g++ -o Assembler Assembler.cpp

After that, there will be a executable-file called "Assembler".


2.Instruction on how to run.
(Lets use command line to run. Assuming that there is a inputfile called test.asm)

$./Assembler test.asm

Then there will be a new file called test.hack which contains the results.

3. Any xxx.asm file would work in my code.
